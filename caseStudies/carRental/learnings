The system will support the renting of different automobiles like cars,
trucks, SUVs, vans, and motorcycles.
Each vehicle should be added with a unique barcode and other details,
including a parking stall number which helps to locate the vehicle.
The system should be able to retrieve information like which member took a
particular vehicle or what vehicles have been rented out by a specific member.
The system should collect a late-fee for vehicles returned after the due date.
Members should be able to search the vehicle inventory and reserve any available vehicle
The system should be able to send notifications whenever the reservation is approaching the pick-up date,
as well as when the vehicle is nearing the due date or has not been returned within the due date.
Members can add rental insurance to their reservation.
Members can rent additional equipment, like navigation, child seat, ski rack, etc.
Members can add additional services to their reservation, such as roadside assistance, additional driver, wifi, etc.
-- (interface, concrete impl & list in booking)
-- since we're dealing with objects, we should use deep copy or shallow copy?

problems -
getAvailableVehicleStrategy - ??
scheduled notifications - done
logging - done
calculate fee after amenities, services etc are added. - ??
Will have to update Booking class to add these
is that feasible? any pattern that we can use? --- assume shallow

ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();

        // Run scheduler every hour
        executor.scheduleAtFixedRate(() -> {
            try {
                scheduler.run();
            } catch (Exception e) {
                System.err.println("Error while running scheduler: " + e.getMessage());
            }
        }, 0, 1, TimeUnit.HOURS);

> in notification service, should we send only booking or send user separately?
maybe separately because in booking we can just have userid.
can return details of this user using userService

> //one & many configuration? in one insurance, many insurance?

> make constructors public

> services like inventory etc can be pulled outside of the CarRentalService.
While initializing CarRentalService, we can give those in the constructor of CarRentalService.

Q>> where to instantiate small services like vehicle inventory, payments etc?
