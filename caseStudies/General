1. mode & command executors
2. assume that user gives correct input. for eg, give valid ticket number when
leaving or correct slot number.
3. strategy - plug and play, can be plugged in other applications also.
4. exceptions
5. services

> assume shallow copy (insurance & other amenities)

Q>> where to instantiate small services like vehicle inventory, payments, logservice etc?
- better to instantiate them in main method and pass them as dependencies to CarRentalService

> For creating exceptions, there are two ways.
1. create enums with custom values
2. create specific exceptions by extending RuntimeException and pass those enums here.
3. throw runtime exections only and pass enum exceptions there.
- 3 might be faulty because we will have to go and change the enum everywhere manually?
- 2 is better because > Future-proofing
If later you add more information to the exception (like vehicleId, availableDate), you can add fields and methods in your custom exception.
With RuntimeException + message only, youâ€™re stuck parsing strings.
